If using any of the protocol, scripts or ideas please cite the article above (SOON). Thanks and happy modeling!!!

This github contains the following:

    RosettaGPCRPocketSize_Protocol_Capture.docx: Protocol capture to create your own models from the input data or create constraint files for refining the binding pocket
    ADRB1_example and CXCR4_example: two examples with all the scripts and some pre-generated results for comparison
    several scripts for generating a BW file, build constraint files, setup RosettaGPCR with an updated XML script and calculating the volume and filtering the results
    Supporting tables with distances of selected pocket residues in all inactive class A GPCRs and their respective volume
